  Answer the questions below.  You answers to questions should be
  correct F# code written after the question. This file is an F#
  script file, it should be possible to load the whole file at
  once. If you can't then you have introduced a syntax error
  somewhere.

  This coursework will be graded. When submitting the coursework,
  call the file you submit "Lastname_Firstname.fsx" with your first
  and last name appropriately, attach it to an e-mail with
  subject line "[ITT8060] Coursework 9", and send it to
  itt8060@cs.ttu.ee.

  The coursework is due on December 4.

*)

// 1. Memoize the fibonacci function.

// 2. Define the product of a list of integers in the naive way.

// 3. Define a tail recursive version of product of a list of integers

// 4. Define infinite node labelled trees using Lazy.

// 5. Define map for infinite trees.
  
// 6. Make a generator for infinite trees which makes trees like this:

(*
       n 
    /     \
 (n+1)   (n+1)
  ...     ...
*)
// Does your generator duplicate work?

// 7.  Implement flatten from infinite trees to infinite lists
//     (defined in the lecture).
